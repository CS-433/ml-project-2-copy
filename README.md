# ml-project-2-copy

## Description
This project is part of the EPFL Machine Learning course for fall 2021 and was implemented by Younes Moussaif, Cl√©mence Barsi and Pauline Conti.

The aim of this project is to predict implement machine learning models able to predict if a tweet used to contain a ":)" or ":(" smiley face. The training data available contains 2.5 Million tweets that the models implemented need to correctly classify as positive or negative. To obtain our test accuracy, we uploaded our submissions to AIcrowd.


## Versions and Libraries
The python libraries and versions used for this project are listed below:
- python = 3.7.11
- scipy = 1.7.1
- pandas = 1.3.4
- numpy = 1.21.2
- matplotlib = 3.5.0
- pytorch = 1.10.1
  - torchvision = 0.11.2
  - torchaudio = 0.10.1
  - cudatoolkit = 10.2
- scikit-learn = 1.0.1
- jupyterlab = 3.2.1
  - nb_conda_kernels
- nltk = 4.62.3
- transformers = 4.14.1

In order to run the notebooks, run the following command when the environnement with the above dependencies is active:
```conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets```

## How to Use
To run our best performing model, the script run.py must be ran having 
//the files test.csv and train.csv in a folder Data. The predictions will be generated in an output.csv file.
