# ml-project-2-copy

## Description
This project is part of the EPFL Machine Learning course for fall 2021 and was implemented by Younes Moussaif, Cl√©mence Barsi and Pauline Conti.

The aim of this project is to predict implement machine learning models able to predict if a tweet used to contain a ":)" or ":(" smiley face. The training data available contains 2.5 Million tweets that the models implemented need to correctly classify as positive or negative. 

## Versions and Libraries
The python libraries and versions used for this project are listed below:
- python = 3.7.11
- scipy = 
- pandas = 1.3.4
- numpy = 1.21.2
- matplotlib =
- pytorch =
  - torchvision =
  - torchaudio =
  - cudatoolkit = 10.2
- scikit-learn = 1.0.1
- jupyterlab = 
  - nb_conda_kernels
- nltk = 4.62.3
- transformers = 4.14.1

In order to run the notebooks, run the following command when the environnement with the above dependencies is active:
```conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets```

## How to Use
To run our best performing model, the script run.py must be ran having 
//the files test.csv and train.csv in a folder Data. The predictions will be generated in an output.csv file.
